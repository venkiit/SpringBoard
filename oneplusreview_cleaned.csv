Raghuram Madireddy,Speed that you need... Simply Awesome..... Most Powerful Phone in Smartphone Industry..!!!!!!!!!!!,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"The OnePlus 6T is a truly great phone no matter what the price, but at half the cost of an iPhone XS with a cutting-edge in display fingerprint sensor this is the bargain buy of the year. Everybody is complaing about in-display fingerprint scanner is slow but trust me its very very very fast, phone gets unlocked as soon as your finger touches the screen and more accurate than other phones, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesn‚Äôt have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just 37K. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom is simply amazing, coming to camera the new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good Portrait mode works as advertised, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good and when you use the fingerprint sensor the night mode for the display is disabled temporarily and then fades back in once you‚Äôve unlocked the phone. The phone comes with a screen protector already on it. the single bottom-firing speaker is loud and has a relatively large amount of bass for the phone, but is easily blocked while playing a game. OnePlus‚Äôs alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and is still brilliant. OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. That‚Äôs changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing what‚Äôs possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and it‚Äôs a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive. there‚Äôs no wireless charging, it doesn‚Äôt have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.
Pros:- Good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5, great software, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, affordable price relative to premium phones, last but not least Blazing fast software
Cons:- No notification light, glass back but no wireless charging, no expandable storage.
Overall phone is excellent and it really delivers it's tagline Never Settle.

Selfie also come clean and sharp. 6gb ram can run two demanding games simultaneously in split screen without any lag. Apps looks nice on bigger screen, even videos looks great with sharp viewing angles and bright colors.
Dash charge, charges very fast keeping the battery long enough for 8-9 hours for heavy users.
In display fingerprint works like charm with beautiful animation but doesn't seem to be faster than previous type of scanner. Though face unlock is more faster than all.
Only downside is from software side, oxygen os is very fluid and smooth, 1)android pie has its issues, adaptive brightness automatically shift itself to lowest light every time screen goes off. So need update on that side.

* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.
* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).
* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.
* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.

Utkarsh D,Beautiful Beast,6 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations. I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.
Pros :-
1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.
2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.
3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.
4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.
5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.
6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.
Cons:-
1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.
2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.
3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.
4) No dual speaker.
Conclusion:
It is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others. So you may go for it.; I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations.

Coming to notification light ...it does pops up the notification u need to activate them .
Finger print lock ...well if you lift ur finger too fast it won‚Äôt detect ...otherwise it‚Äôs fast , face unlock is very fast ....face unlock in dark will also work but u need to activate those from settings ....for those who have doubt go to YouTube and see tips for oneplus 6t .a video in 2 parts are there it will help you in all the settings
There is also option for hidden apps which is great feature

SAM,Crafted with passion,7 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"This device is clearly ahead of its pack for the hardware and features provided in this price range. Since everyone is well aware of the specs I'll just provide my experience while using this device.
1. Sharp well balanced pictures during daytime and nightscape mode does a decent effort to reduce graininess and camera shake while taking night shots with low ISO settings. Still room for improvement though.
2. As for sound quality I never use phone speakers while listening to music and prefer my Bluetooth headphones as I hate wires. I'm glad headphone jack is absent. One less vestigial organ to worry about as we move forward. Thank you oneplus. Call clarity is good as expected.
3. Marriage of bloatfree oxygen os alongwith snapdragon 845 makes this phone a pure joy to use. Fast snappy and responsive! In screen fingerprint sensor though takes more time to unlock than the physical one at the back earlier, but this has been hid well by the animations provided.
4. Battery life is excellent and I'm using dark theme which further reduces battery consumption. Gives me more than one day of usage without playing any games.
5. Body has been exquisitely crafted and with the gorilla 6 screen and teardrop notch this is one of the best displays you can get at present. I would have still preferred a metal unibody instead of the glass back though.
All in all I would say you'd feel proud and satisfied to own this device. If you can shell out the extra dough go for the 8 gb versions.

In screen Fingerprint sensor is pretty good but not quite as fast as the physical sensor. However the difference is minor. Camera is same as oneplus 6 with some software improvements.

Surya Kiran,Value for money. Hardware and Software are top notch.,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.
Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.
I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.

6T ticks all the boxes of the modern day flagships, plus it has in-display fingerprint which is surprisingly fast and more convenient than the one mounted on the back.
It has improved battery backup, large storage options at relatively same price, excellent memory management and the best UI you will find on a phone.
The Oxygen OS gives you the latest offerings from Android and is very responsive and very pleasing just to look at!üòç It gives you a lot of customisation options to make your phone feel more personal.
The only small setback is an average camera. But don't worry, it's pretty good and can do a great job capturing images and won't disappoint you.
This is the best buy for 30-40k budget segment and you won't regret buying it.
I am very happy with this phone.üòç

Worth mentioning the Oxygen OS is one of the best in market and has the capability to challenge the IOS. Its a bliss to play games in OP 6t. Camera is good and specially the nightscape mode.
Charging is very fast with the dash charger. Fingerprint and face unlock is swift. This is a kind of phone you can easily recommend to someone.
But they could have easily added the headphone jack.

Aman,Switching over from Apple!,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Switching over from my Iphone 8 to Oneplus 6t.
1 - Speed
Yes, Oneplus claims the truth that you're going to ""Unlock Speed"" with this one. The face unlock and brand new in display fingerprint in this phone is insanely fast.
2- Hardware
The built quality of the phone gives you a very premium feel, glass back , amazing curved design, oled screen and teardrop notch can give a bummer to any other premium smartphone in the market.
3- Processor
Damn, I love this one, Snapdragon 845 and 8GB of RAM makes it one of the fastest phones in the world right now, get ready for an amazing never lagging gaming experience and user interface.
4- Software
Andriod 9, Pie and Oxygen OS makes the interface of the phone look beautiful, and it looks beautiful to me as I've been using apple for past two years with same interface. Gestures, customizations and various other oxygen os features give you a very good in-phone experience.
5- Camera
Amazing for low light photography, I haven't test the camera much, would edit my review after testing it for sometime.
CONS
1- It would be great if Oneplus launches phones with IP water resistant certificate and Wireless Charging from next time.
2- Include the Type C bullet earphones inside the box itself. They're out of stock on amazon.; Switching over from my Iphone 8 to Oneplus 6t.; 1 - Speed; Yes, Oneplus claims the truth that you're going to ""Unlock Speed"" with this one.

Sharath,Fast and Smooth. The BEASTüòà,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Amazon Delivery is excellent as always. Got it delivered within a day, that too, to my native city(Non Metro, not Bangalore).
Coming to phone itself, had ordered Mirror Black 8/128 GB variant.
Pros:
1. Excellent build quality
2. Great fluid smooth Oxygen OS
3. Display is gorgeous. Feels bit longer and tad narrower than OnePlus 6's screen. (Tech spec also says so.)
4. Felt sound quality over earphones (JBL E1+) is great... Compared to my previous OnePlus2. Felt comparatively better than OnePlus6. Though I don't have any test result to show, I just heard sound effects of same song on both OnePlus6 and 6T, Base and clarity of music on OnePlus 6T just felt refined if not same.
5. Camera. Just awesome. Nightscape is good in low light. Very snappy camera. They r soft features which r coming to OnePlus 6 anyway.
6. In Display fingerprint, well it's a good tech. Works well most of the time,even though not as fast as physical sensor. Did a false unlock with non registered finger when I was testing üòä. It happened just once. Bleeds bright light from the sensor area while unlocking,(well that's how it's technology work)which might be annoying during night with sleepy eyesüòê. Face unlock works like a charm.Its even faster than Screen Unlock. Only downside is Face unlock is image based.hence require sufficient light on face to recognize you. Also, you need to turn on screen to unlock, unlike IR based sensor in iPhone X or Huawei Mate 20.
7. PUBG game looks gorgeous with HDR and Ultra frame rate settings. No lag or stuttering whatsoever. Game runs fast n smooth with great graphics.
Cons: (not many)
1. In display fingerprint sensor even though worlds fastest among In Display sensors in terms of unlocking speed, need more polishing. Not as fast as physical. But u will not know much difference if u r coming from OnePlus2. Unlocking bleeds bright light on sensor area might be annoying at night.
2. No Headphone jack might be deal breaker for some. But they give type c to 3.5mm adapter in box. So shud not be as much as deal breaker. Pre-Order will fetch u a type c headphones for free.

Dipankar Chatterjee,Good smartphone with some minor glitches!,8 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Purchased the One Plus 6T from Amazon yesterday.
It's a great smartphone, a flagship killer. Here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
1) Great super AMOLED display, with high screen to aspect ratio and notch hiding option.
2) Good camera with life like colours, with OIS/EIS making video shooting stable.
3)Good battery life.
4) Fast processor and an easy to use OS, with no unnecessary bloatware.
5) Charging is fast and hassle free, like all One Plus phones.
6) Fingerprint and face unlock is simultaneous, and reasonably fast.
7) Absence of notification light is not missed, rather it's a blessing in disguise !
Cons:
1) Too heavy, fingers hurt after holding it for some time.
2) Screen flash for the selfie camera takes lighted, but grainy photos in pitch darkness. The Vivo V11 Pro selfie camera also uses screen flash,but the photos are less grainy.
3) Poor ring tone selection, you have to download ring tones.
4) No in built FM radio.
5) Good sound output, but mono non stereo sound coming from 1 speaker.
6) Potrait mode / Bokeh effect snaps are just average, both for the front and rear cameras, background contrast is poor and uneven. The Vivo V11 Pro takes better potrait photos.
7) Mirror black version and the plastic cover is prone to fingerprint smudges and attracts dust. It has to be wiped regularly with a cloth.

Anuraag Das,Compromise on the headphone jack and you get so much more.,10 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Pros:
Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.
Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.
Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.
I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.
Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :D
coming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).
It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.
Ummm what else....
Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.
But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..
Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...
But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.
Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!
Cons:
The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.
Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.
The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!
It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!
Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!

Amazon Customer,True Flagship Killer,9 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:
Pros:
i. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.
ii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.
iii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.
iv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.
v. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.
vi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.
Cons:
i. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)
ii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.
iii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyes
Overall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.

1. Battery Life Has Improved a lot thanks for the upgrade OnePlus.
2. Camera Quality has improved, I was missing the OIS but now nothing to Worry.
3. The Water Droplet Notch is not a Hindrance at all. The display quality is what one should be.
4. After the last Update the Screen Unlock Has become Even Faster. I really don't find a difference in the speed between the Physical Finger print scanner and this Indisplay one. It's equally Fast.

Sarthak Dhingra,Not a flagship anymore,9 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Upgraded from 6 to 6t
My one line review - "" I will pick 6 anytime over 6t""
Some Important Points :
On Screen fingerprint sensor is fast but of course not that past as physical fingerprint sensor
Camera there is no change except the so called NIGHTSCAPE and if you are expecting it to be like one in pixel let me tell you that is a complete no
Algorithms of both the phones are different for low light photos and one used in one plus is bit shaggy .
It basically illuminates the light sources present in the photo and spread it evenly over the entire click
Screen is good , notch is better than that old notch
Battery is average , though they have increased the capacity but i dont see major differences in screen on time . Dash charge though is the best thing about one plus

Sahil,Some issues u must read.,5 November 2018,Size: 8+256 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Hello,
Now I've been using this beast since few days, this phone is a beast there are no complains against anything about this phone.
Battery is perfect around 8-9 hours of onscreen time recharges quick as promised.
Cameras are awesome no doubt about that.
OS and UI are very smooth and easy to use.
There are some issues which are to be looked after:
1. The inbuilt fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work quickly, I have to place my thumb 1-2 times in different position to get it work.
2. Again the fingerprint sensor at night time when all lights are off and when you unlock ur phone with fingerprint sensor the screen brighten ups to it's fullest (like it's stealing my eyesight üòú)
3. The night scape mode in camera it processes too long which is embarrassing when I'm showing off this features to friends
4. The most important thing this is not actually an issue, but just a suggestion - I really miss the notification LED light, because every time I've to pick up the phone to check wether I have a notification or not or for what my phone had buzzed.
There's a app called as NO LED available on play store which uses some pixels to color up and show up in the lock screen but it's annoying I'm sure OnePlus can definitely come with a better app or solution.
I'm sure this issues can easily resolved by the company in a software update.
Thanks for reading.

Let's talk about the pros first:
Clean UI and blazing speed:
Speed and clean UI is the best in class when comes to OnePlus devices, one of the best UI I have used till now. Performance is only next to iPhone xs max and mate 20 pro, however these devices are much costlier than 6t
Display:
It's fricking good , one of the best full HD display in this range
In display finger print scanner:
Guys, this is so so good, it's very fast, not lagging as mentioned in other reviews
Battery:
Again a department where OnePlus 6t takes a big leap. I have been using poco F1 with 4000 mih battery, but 6t with 3700 mih lasts longer than poco F1.
Camera:
Camera is better than poco F1, however the night mode of 6t cannot be compared with pixel 3( you can take a shot in pitch dark), this is where OnePlus has to improve if it wants to become real flagship rather than being `flagship killer`. However I am happy with camera performance considering the price point.
Cons:
None - it would be unfair to mention anything in cons as I don't find any.
Final verdict: OnePlus has put in their heart and soul in making 6t .; One of the best phones I have used till date, you will not regret buying it.; Let's talk about the pros first:; Clean UI and blazing speed:; Speed and clean UI is the best in class when comes to OnePlus devices, one of the best UI I have used till now.

Yes, 6t offers a lot of excellent features: its superb display, flagship hardware, software, excellent performance, great camera and, to some extent, good battery life, but the loss of some useful feature will deter many potential buyers accustomed with headphones and notification light.; The new Oneplus Avtar will certainly satisfy those users who can compromise with the loss of 3.5 headphone jack and notification led.

Anonymous,Best value. Better than stock.,10 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"I was considering pixel 3xl, but believe me this is way more better than half a pixel 3xl(may be even better than a full one ..lol). This phone is super practical and is a real companion in your day to day tasks. The gestures are beautiful. RAM is so much that I guess whole OS would fit in making everything just spontaneous. Zero lag in any thing. The draw V to start torch is super handy. Camera might not be like pixel 3xl, but for a person who takes normal amount of photos, it is more than sufficient. You won't be unhappy at all with camera.
It comes with screen protector preapplied. A very good case.
No headphones - not a big deal(u probably will buy your own at some stage)
Fingerprint sensor is like just a little bit under 1 second. But it won't make your life slow at all.

Battery life is legendary... Getting close to 6 hrs of SOT nd that's just phenomenal.
Camera is great, may not compete with the pixel but who wants to anyway. At the price its just great.
Lack of a headphone jack is a definite letdown but keep the in box dongle fixed to your existing earphones or upgrade to some good Bluetooth headsets during sale.
Have not seen any major issues yet and performance is very smooth and super fast.
The animations may feel a bit too buttery for some, in such cases go for changing animation scale in the developer options.

Pros.
‚Ä¢amazing speed amazing with fast charging and very clean OS
‚Ä¢speakers are too damn good
‚Ä¢the inbuilt fingerprint sensor is very fast and looks pretty cool so is the face unlock
‚Ä¢really premium look and solid built
‚Ä¢Gorilla glass 6 protection
Cons
‚Ä¢ nightscape mode doesn't work as fine when compared to pixel 3 XL or what has been show at that launch
‚Ä¢ again the camera is just average but really better than poco f1 but not as good as pixel 3xl ,but it works fine
‚Ä¢3.5 mm headphone jack is missing but don't worry you won't miss him that much the type C headphones are quite amazing
‚Ä¢someone's are found When You oxygen OS but oneplus will remove them very quickly
Verdict : go for it it's the best phone in price range and I would say it's far better than poco F1.

Aniket Mishra,An Excellent Flaghip Killer,7 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Truely an amazing phone. Wanted to post the review after 1 day of use but was unable to do so because of some technical glitch at Amazon's end.
1 - Battery - Its very good as it lasts approximately 30-32 hours including 2 hours of music playback on Amazon Prime through Bluetooth, decent number of calls, 4G VoLTE on through out the duration.
2 - Camera - Not spectacular or something but overall good. In natural daylight the pics are amazing, but during night time in the night mode the pics look a bit artificial because of the saturation and lighting. Slow video recording is amazing. Front Camera is good enough and comes with a screen flash.
3 - Screen & Notch - The display is simply amazing with an option to hide the notch manually. The bezels at the bottom are bit thick and could have been thinner. the viewing angles are amazing.
4 - Sound - The sound is a feature which disappointed me in this phone. No doubt it is loud but the treble is not good. It lacks clarity. May be there would be changes over time.
5 - Charging - This is simply out of the world. The Dash Charge is superb and it charges the phone from 46-100% in approx 35 mins.
6 - In Display Fingerprint scanner - It is very accurate and takes a bit of time to calibrate. It is a bit slow as compared to the conventional fingerprint scanners.
7 - Face Unlock - Its outstanding. It unlocks the phone the moment you look at the screen when the screen is on. It is secure also as it doesn't unlock the phone if your eyes are closed.
Overall - Its an amazing phone and a must buy at this price and given the specs. Other companies trying to troll this by showing off their low prices can never match with the quality. And they also provide a back case along with it which is cool enough as you don't have to search for one.; Truely an amazing phone.

SAM,Crafted with passion,7 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"This device is clearly ahead of its pack for the hardware and features provided in this price range. Since everyone is well aware of the specs I'll just provide my experience while using this device.
1. Sharp well balanced pictures during daytime and nightscape mode does a decent effort to reduce graininess and camera shake while taking night shots with low ISO settings. Still room for improvement though.
2. As for sound quality I never use phone speakers while listening to music and prefer my Bluetooth headphones as I hate wires. I'm glad headphone jack is absent. One less vestigial organ to worry about as we move forward. Thank you oneplus. Call clarity is good as expected.
3. Marriage of bloatfree oxygen os alongwith snapdragon 845 makes this phone a pure joy to use. Fast snappy and responsive! In screen fingerprint sensor though takes more time to unlock than the physical one at the back earlier, but this has been hid well by the animations provided.
4. Battery life is excellent and I'm using dark theme which further reduces battery consumption. Gives me more than one day of usage without playing any games.
5. Body has been exquisitely crafted and with the gorilla 6 screen and teardrop notch this is one of the best displays you can get at present. I would have still preferred a metal unibody instead of the glass back though.
All in all I would say you'd feel proud and satisfied to own this device. If you can shell out the extra dough go for the 8 gb versions.

+Dash Charging is super cool. 5*

+S845 is undoubtedly powerful and apps load and work seamlessly 5*
+Great gaming experience ( with not much of heating issue & battery drain) 5*
+Great sound quality (5*)
Cons:
-Indisplay fingerprint scanner seems not a very useful thing. Its difficult to use it (better go with face unlock). It will be much better only if you add all 10 fingers :-) 3*
-Fingerprint scanning is comparatively slow (lot of catchy graphics) and sometimes delayed if a wrong finger was used. 2*
-Using without a cover is too risky - the back cover is very slippery . But using a cover the phone looses its identity though.
-No AUX port, though a type-C to AUX cable is provided with the pack, carrying it all the time is difficult .

Karthik R N,Beast,7 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it's a beast of a mobile. At this price range it's definitely a great value for money. OnePlus has been launching amazing phone's and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.
Games are running at ultra or high. Haven't hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.
Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.
The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won't necessarily do that üòÑ. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it).
 In-display FP sensor is faster. I don't have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it's faster than fast-enough.
Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It's like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.
Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It's like I'm hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I'm either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.
Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.
Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn't find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days üòÑ . So I've ordered 3 of them üòÅ let's see which will fit, I'll return the other 2.
The protective bumper case is 2k, though it's official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don't say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product's accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass.
 Waiting for the wireless bullets, hopefully will get it soon and review that. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.; I got 8GB * 128GB version.

TAM,OnePlus 6T : Battery Beast !,6 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Build Quality : 10/10
Camera: 8/10 (Though, I believe this will change with software updates in the future)

Should You buy this over Poco f1?
Ans: Yes, If you want better service guarantee and a well-built phone + Under Display FP Scanner.
CAMERA:
The camera is pretty decent for the price. The hardware setup which they are using is top tier but the only place where the camera falls short is the poor algorithm for Night Mode. Rest assured, XDA devs will probably push a Gcam later this month which will most probably pull the camera department upto a Solid 9 if not 10. Will update once that happens !

Vicky Joshi,Make sure you read description First not stars only #Pubg,6 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Well if you are moving from another brand to 6T than u will surely give almost 5 stars but I am using 3T since its launched and 5t from last 6 months so it's not giving me lots of supises which I was expected.
Cons:
- length is too much, not possible to operate with one hand or typing and some other task will be more though than you ever imagined.
- no headphone jack and that dongle is not that much of robust like many times its got unplugged in pocket. Need to buy type C bullets now
- front camera is overall average and as phone is not handy pictures will be blurred many times
- NO Notification Light (sad react only)
- I am tired now while writing this post
- Its not that much of bright as compared to 3T in dark room
- In display finger print is not working sometimes especially when your hands are dirty like dust and wet and slow to compare 3t n 5t or even many times display blinks and notification panel comes down software bugs I can say..
- Round corners are creating a weirdo view in many applications and it's feel faulty.
- That dewdrop notch is really really annoying while using some applications and your eyes will move there multiple times
- notification icons are very small and sometimes hide when there are many including network speed
- Phone is very heavy, well I am 6 ft tall and beast too yet it's annoying so think about it when you are girl where hands are soft and small :p
- There are lots of software bugs which I can say they will fix in sometimes #hope
Why I choose to upgrade because 3T is now old for me and I needed new UI and Latest chip and OnePlus performance was always good and based on personal experience I can't think about another flagship, well Note 9 was in cart earlier but almost 20k more after discount seems bad deal so 6T becomes final choice..
- After some rounds of PubG you will tired as phone is big and heavy
Prons:
- 7 hours continues play in Pubg with HDR and High frame rates, awesome experience like never before even in 5T. I am already in ace tire and now trying to reach in top 500 players and this device will surely helps me.
- Pictures Quality is amazing when you click photos through rear camera now I will have surely a great pictures of Diwali 2018
- Night mode is unbelievable when I clicked picture of my bed with lights off OMG.
- Sound is 20% more loud than 3t and 5t its feels
- It was 20% charged after 11 hours of using including two classic solo games in Pubg top 3 both the time which was I consider as surprise.
- User experience is good and oygen os trying to show every information in a good manners.
I have written above details based on 2 days of usage and I will again update this after this week of usage.

Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one.

asir,A good phone from OnePlus! But ....,6 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"First thing first there is nothing wrong with one plus 6t.The screen is amoled which has good viewing angles.Colours are vibrant and screen brightness is also good.Camera is great but could have been better.

Deb Kumar Dasgupta,Great value for money product...,6 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Let's start with the notch as this is my first time with a notch device...
I'm not a fan of notches but the notch that comes with this device doesn't come across (to me at least) as irritating... The teardrop shape blends in quite well with the rest of the body of the device...
The device is as smooth & fluid as you would expect from OnePlus and the face recognition works incredibly fast... The good part that I discovered about the face unlock feature is that I registered my face without my glasses but it still recognizes me and unlocks the phone every time... So no worries with it leaving you hanging after a tough day when you can't be bothered to look carefully at your device for the face unlock to work...
That brings me to the in-display fingerprint scanner... In most situations the face unlock is too quick and so I don't even need to use it but the scanner on itself works just ok... It's nowhere near as fast as the modern day fingerprint scanners on the backs of devices and the unlock speed of this phone with fingerprint is around the same as my OnePlus 2 from 2015... The only advantage is that the huge display you get and it's quite something to see up close (for me)...
Battery life is incredible as well... I charge it for about 45mins to an hour everyday and it lasts me the whole day... Although I would say that I'm not a very hardcore phone user like I used to be but the phone lives up to it's expectation as you would want... Look up reviews on YT if you're really interested in getting this device...
Picture quality is great in the phone, far greater than I could imagine... Takes clear shots and the slow motion also looks amazing... It just gets a little heated up after you shoot in slowmo or take a video in 4k-60FPS...
Sound quality is as usual from the outside speakers and there's no headphone jack... It's annoying of course and so I've got a separate pair of earphones for specifically this phone and have connected the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter to it... I don't take it off and so that we way I'm less likely to loose it... So that takes care of the little issue...
And yeah, the device is waterproof actually... Even though there isn't any official certification, it's waterproof to a decent extent...
The only thing I wish to be changed about this device for now is the placement of the volume button... Unlike my previous OnePlus 2, they put the alert slider above the power button and the volume button on the left for the OnePlus 6T...
This gets extremely weird from what was just working fine (volume button above the power button and alert slider in the left) in my opinion but that's just my personal bias...
Overall the phone is definitely a fantastic package for the price...; Let's start with the notch as this is my first time with a notch device...; I'm not a fan of notches but the notch that comes with this device doesn't come across (to me at least) as irritating...

Arth patel,Not The best but not The bad....It's good in this range.,6 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Everything is good but the camera's picture quality is worst....it's disappointing factor for me even my iPhone 6 clicks good photos some times to compare OP6T. Sometimes auto focus is not working as well as picture quality is not good if you clicked 4-5 pics, 2-3 pics are out of focus and in night photography there are too much noise.
And second problem is some times in display fingerprint not works well....taking too much time to recognize.
-Battery backup is good (It's enough for whole 1 day if you charged once in the morning....Full charging gets approx 1.5 hr time)
-Sound quality is average. Noisy speaker feels like a cheap. Some times I missed 3.5 jack.
-Premium looks and display quality are awesome.
-Speed and performance are fantastic.
-And last It's Feels heavy.
-Otherwise all things good.

Karan,Read this before you purchase OnePlus 6T,6 November 2018,Size: 8+256 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Switched from 3t to 6t 256 gb. This phone is probably the best in the market. Battery is phenomenal. Headphone jack? All those people saying that no headphone jack are probably bunch of idiots. And the reason why I am saying that is there is a headphone jack, that charger jack because I myself was skeptical about it but you don't need to charge and listen to music since charging is so fast you'll probably just need to wait for 10-15 minutes for a long hour usage. Best phone hands down. AND THE INCREASE IN BATTERY LIFE CAN BE SEEN EASILY. I PLAYED PUBG 5 MATCHES, THEN WATCHED A MOVIE ON THE PHONE AND EVEN THEN THERE WAS A GOOD AMOUNT OF BATTERY PERCENTAGE LEFT. AND the finger print. Haha, This is the best part. Indisplay fingerprint is very fast. And the implementation of a fingerprint inside a display is phenomenal with the speed OnePlus has given since it doesn't really take time to open. The GESTURES are exactly what I needed. Use OnePlus gestures instead of Google and it is totally worth it. Speakers are pretty loud even though there is one faux speaker for the aesthetics.
Overall? This phone is miles ahead of OnePlus 6 with
 Better notch(the best implementation of notch and completely distinguished itself from the rest)
 Bigger battery
Finger print display
ALMOST NO BEZELS.

Ritz,Best Android phone,6 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Pros
Best screen quality
Best camera and many options are like professional camera. However picture pixel quality is not great when compared to my Moto X play. Moto X play gets best pics and you can vouch the quality by zooming in the pics.
Oxygen os resembles pure android and no need to learn weird os.
Get a cashback of 2000 on icici and Citi Bank card.
Delivery was much faster and packaging was great too with pin code to ensure that package goes in right hands.
Many options are given by default and no need to install third party tools. E.g. call recording, night mode and reading mode options.
Cons
Bulkier than OnePlus 5
3vwn though it is thicker than OnePlus 5 it doesn't have 3.5 jack

Utkarsh D,Beautiful Beast,6 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations. I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.
Pros :-
1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.
2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.
3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.
4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.
5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.
6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.
Cons:-
1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.
2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.
3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.
4) No dual speaker.
Conclusion:
It is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others.

Processor (at par with the best smartphones available currently, great for high end gaming and multi tasking)
Display (great resolution)
Looks (very premium)
Battery Life (excellent fast charging, an hour's PUBG play sees a battery loss of merely 15%)
Sound quality (Single firing speaker does the job well)
In-display fingerprint scanner (after the 1st update it works perfectly well each time and it's lightning fast and the animation is a stunner)
Face-recognition unlock (Best is class, works in milliseconds even in low lighting conditions)
Cons:
Camera is a disappointment (there are lower value phones whose cameras are much better, nightscape mode is okay if you have very stable hands, use a stand)
Mirror back is a finger print magnet (impossible to use without a case)
Omission of the 3.5mm headphone jack (using the dongle is an embarrassment)

All the features are really good. Oneplus has been consistent in upgrading their brand & added new features into their phones. I am skipping the PROs of the phone(which is a huge list, already described by many ppl)
CONs:

1. New in-screen fingerprint sensor - Very slow as compare to normal fingerprint sensor.

3. Notch - Tear drop notch is good as compared to other notch sizes and you get more screen size.

So, I started searching and read a lot of posts on what is the best phone available right now. I had a few options. LG Q7+, poco, mate 20(not yet released) etc. But after a lot of speculation and hype I went on with the OnePlus 6t.
Pros:
1) Good screen(not the best in the business though)
2) Solid Build Quality
3) Premium feel and a good looking phone
4) Solid battery(1 and a half day of regular use)
5) Decent camera.(cannot compare it to the pixels and the iPhones of the world)
6) Good value for money.
7) Android pie
8) Dash charger.(best in the business)
Cons:
1) A little problematic with the Bluetooth connectivity. My old phone S8 had no problems when using a Bluetooth headset. But there is a small issue in this phone. I have to restart the phone again to get it working properly.
2) Speaker quality.
3) On screen fingerprint scanner.(Accuracy-7/10) and a little slow(hopefully software updates will fix it).; First of all, I had a Samsung S8 and I wanted to buy a new phone.

himanshu,Oneplus6 vs oneplus6T,5 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"OnePlus 6T Pros
Bigger display with water drop notch design look beautiful and AMOLED panel also very good.
OnePlus 6T has upgraded 370mAh battery which is 400mAh bigger then OnePlus 6. It also comes with Dash charger one of the fastest smartphone chargers.
The base variant comes with 6GB RAM 128GB of storage and price are same as OnePlus 6 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant.
The main highlight it has the in-display fingerprint sensor and this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint sensors.
OnePlus known for their stock like Oxygen OS and this time the OnePlus 6T comes with Android 9 pie.
New Camera mode like Nightscape and some other photography features are really good.
OnePlus 6T Cons
The Oneplus company known to listen to their consumer‚Äôs voice, but this time There is no 3.5mm audio jack.
The main cons of all OnePlus devices are lacs on microSD card support, yes it does not have any microSD card slot.
There is no IP rating for waterproof and dustproof.
OnePlus 6T does not have dual speakers like it should because other brands are now offering dual speaker setup.
This time OnePlus also use glass at the back but it does not support wireless charging. Now, these days every flagship smartphone has wireless charging support.
Frankly speaking the OnePlus 6 still a good device there is no major improvement on OnePlus 6T. If you are a OnePlus fan and wants to buy a new smartphone then you can buy this. But if you already have the OnePlus 6 then don‚Äôt waste your money because OnePlus 6 will get all the software feature via OTA updates...; OnePlus 6T Pros; Bigger display with water drop notch design look beautiful and AMOLED panel also very good.; OnePlus 6T has upgraded 370mAh battery which is 400mAh bigger then OnePlus 6.

Sahil,Some issues u must read.,5 November 2018,Size: 8+256 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Hello,
Now I've been using this beast since few days, this phone is a beast there are no complains against anything about this phone.
Battery is perfect around 8-9 hours of onscreen time recharges quick as promised.
Cameras are awesome no doubt about that.
OS and UI are very smooth and easy to use.
There are some issues which are to be looked after:
1. The inbuilt fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work quickly, I have to place my thumb 1-2 times in different position to get it work.
2. Again the fingerprint sensor at night time when all lights are off and when you unlock ur phone with fingerprint sensor the screen brighten ups to it's fullest (like it's stealing my eyesight üòú)
3. The night scape mode in camera it processes too long which is embarrassing when I'm showing off this features to friends
4. The most important thing this is not actually an issue, but just a suggestion - I really miss the notification LED light, because every time I've to pick up the phone to check wether I have a notification or not or for what my phone had buzzed.
There's a app called as NO LED available on play store which uses some pixels to color up and show up in the lock screen but it's annoying I'm sure OnePlus can definitely come with a better app or solution.
I'm sure this issues can easily resolved by the company in a software update.
Thanks for reading.

Gadgito!,Still Value For Money and great phone but now price is on edge.,5 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Overall amazing product for the price point .. but now its on the edge. One plus has been slowly increasing prices year on year and now they are in INR40K range. Further one or more price hikes and people will start going back to Flagship companies. Lets hope they keep it as Value for money.
Regarding phone:
Superb edge to edge display & battery life - No complaints here. 1080P screen is crisp enough and gives good battery life. Notch is actually just tiny camera and bottom chin has become further thinner.
Software: Oxygen OS - as usual its clean and gives stock experience with few customizations. Since phone has been just launched have experienced few bugs, but lets hope one plus gives quick updates to solve these.
Build Quality/looks: Thumbs Up! to OnePlus. Glass black and body design does give premium feel. But somehow felt phone is on heavier side (I have switched from OnePlus5 to OnePlus6T and definitely there's noticeable difference in weight).
Fingerprint scanner: Works well most of the times but not as fast as physical fingerprint scanners we have been used to of earlier phones. If screen gets smudgy you will have problem of unlocking device as it requires clean surface to work.
Only cons, I have experienced in this phone are No headphone jack and LED notification light. Most useful part of LED light was of charging notification. Now you have to wake screen and check. For headphones you do get C-Type connector but as it sounds ""No 3.5mm headphone Jack"" - nothing to describe here.

Daniel S,Nice Smartphone. Just go for it.,5 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"I am an old one plus user who used one plus 3 until I planned to upgrade to this beauty. I will keep it short and this is my honest review and feedback.
Pros:
1. 3700 mAh battery
2. Corning gorilla glass 6 protection
3. Bigger storage that starts from 128 GB
4. New night mode that works like charm
5. Touch and look and feel looks super awesome
6. Oxygen OS 9 and Android pie works sleek and super fast
7. Hidden flash for selfies
8. In display finger print scanner
9. Water drop notch which makes the phone look beautiful
10. Dash charge is superb as always
11. Gaming is awesome. It's sleek and seamless
Cons:
1. Same hardware as one plus 6 with slightly bigger battery and finger print scanner in display
2. No 3.5 mm Jack for headphones which is surprising. Come on OnePlus, you could have adjusted it somewhere for sure. But guys there is a dash to 3.5 mm adapter that comes in the box so it's covered somewhere so don't crib about it
3. No dual speakers in this price range
4. Same camera configuration as one plus 6
5. Same 845 processor as one plus 6. Well this is latest and they didn't have any option
6. The phone is not dust or water resistant. That's bad OnePlus
7. Price of the phone is slightly higher (should have been 3-4 k less)
All in all this phone is an all-rounder. If you could live without 3.5 mm Jack and adjust with indisplay finger print scanner then just go for it as the phone is a perfect treat to all the mid to high end users of a smartphone. You will love it.; I am an old one plus user who used one plus 3 until I planned to upgrade to this beauty. I will keep it short and this is my honest review and feedback.; Pros:; 1. 3700 mAh battery; 2. Corning gorilla glass 6 protection; 3. Bigger storage that starts from 128 GB; 4. New night mode that works like charm; 5. Touch and look and feel looks super awesome; 6. Oxygen OS 9 and Android pie works sleek and super fast; 7. Hidden flash for selfies; 8. In display finger print scanner; 9. Water drop notch which makes the phone look beautiful; 10. Dash charge is superb as always; 11. Gaming is awesome. It's sleek and seamless; Cons:; 1. Same hardware as one plus 6 with slightly bigger battery and finger print scanner in display; 2. No 3.5 mm Jack for headphones which is surprising. Come on OnePlus, you could have adjusted it somewhere for sure. But guys there is a dash to 3.5 mm adapter that comes in the box so it's covered somewhere so don't crib about it; 3. No dual speakers in this price range; 4. Same camera configuration as one plus 6; 5. Same 845 processor as one plus 6. Well this is latest and they didn't have any option; 6. The phone is not dust or water resistant. That's bad OnePlus; 7. Price of the phone is slightly higher (should have been 3-4 k less); All in all this phone is an all-rounder. If you could live without 3.5 mm Jack and adjust with indisplay finger print scanner then just go for it as the phone is a perfect treat to all the mid to high end users of a smartphone. You will love it.",One person found this helpful,Helpful,0,Comment

Aayush Patil,Worth Every Rupee!!!,5 November 2018,Size: 8+256 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.
Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.
Now onto the phone...
Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.
Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.
Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.
Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.
Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.
New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.
Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.
Conclusion:
+Screen
+Battery
+Internals
+Software
+Camera
+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer
-no 3.5mm jack
-no wireless charging (not important for me)

Abdul Quadir,#Fell in love in 0.34 seconds,5 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Life is short ,don't waste it in reading reviews ... If you have the budget
BUY THIS PHONE !!
But since you have decided to read further ... Let's tell you more ...
After days of research.
After hours Gyaan from my gyaani frnz n geeks
I finally settled on Never Settle.
Constantly using this since last 48 hours. I am highlighting specific features over OP6.
Pros :
Speed : More than your expectations , u will not be disappointed even throwing maximum high RAM using apps , its RAM management is over the mark.
Battery:
Lasted on heavy usage for approx 7-8 hours.
Fingerprint Scanner:
Initially it required more firm pressure , but after 10-15 (at max) unlocks you just have to feather touch it. I have enrolled both thumbs and it works pretty smooth and blaze fast , I'm not using face unlock to test scanner more.)
Oxygen OS : Makkhan hai ;)
Display: Lit and bright even in broad daylight.
Type C over 3.5 mm -
Folks I would like to say we are reluctant to adapt this as we are so used to our traditional methods but remember it's technology and we should appreciate the change and upgrade our gadgets accordingly, which ofcourse is a dent to your pocket. Cutting it short I'm still using my apple 3.5mm earphones via the supplied connector and the quality is not compromised neither in the headphones or aux input to your multimedia systems, its loud and crystal clear.
Cons:
Camera is same as one plus 6
Not so impressed with the night mode as its digitally optimising the continuous frames which blurs any moving object but the steady subject is quite clear ...
Overall it has the same camera performance as one plus 6 . Which is awesome.
End Note :
Do the maths ;)
Don't forget to put science, technology, innovation and a garnish of elegant design.
If you have the budget (or likely to make a jugaad from friends n family :D ) own this ... I bet this bae won't disappoint you .
N if you're a one plus 6 user.
Wait for one plus 7 .
For Amazon and Green Mobiles
Folks I would like to appreciate the fast secure and timely delivery of my prepaid package with all due precautions and using the tamper proof package.
This no doubt increased my trust over online purchase of high value items prepaid.
Thank You !!

Mayank Tyagi,"Pros and Cons, I found that -",5 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"OnePlus is on right track to kill the Flagship Phones, and the legacy continues with 6T also. Considering the value for money, it is the best phone one can buy in Rs 50k.
Now, Pros and Cons are -
Pros -
-6.4 inches Super AMOLED display produces punchy and accurate colors with high dynamic range
-Bigger screen to body ratio
-Camera is superb for video recordings as helped by Electronic Image Stabilization, Night mode takes detailed photographs even if there is very low light(refer attached photo taken from Mi A1 and 6T simultaneously)
-Snapdragon 845 provides lightning speed and I observed no lag while playing heavy games, video streamings and switching of apps.
-Great customization tweaks offered by Oxygen OS that helps in basic needs.
-DASH charger helps in charging phones upto 50-60% in 25-30 mins.
-In display fingerprint scanner adds to looks and comfort of the phone.
-Phone feels super premium, thanks to it's metal body and glass back. Comfortable to hold in hand.
-Face recognition works like magic, even in night with no light source around
Cons-
-Portrait mode in camera produce photos with less recognizable blurring between subject and behind scene, sometimes missing focus on subject also.
-I found battery backup to be on a little side compared to OP 6 inspite of larger battery housing.
-Indisplay fingerprint scanner looks amazing but it takes a little time to unlock phone, however it is operable and becomes fast with every use.

Ashish Gurjar,Pros and cons,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgrading
cons of oneplus 6t:
1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always
2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)
3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures
4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone
5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )
Pros:
1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)
2 has good customer care support (especially online)
3 the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at all
for those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7

I love the design but just one thing that the screen curve is a bit too overdone.. it's a lot of curve for this beauty.
The phone is snappy and you can choose to remove the animations and make it look faster than it already is out of the box.
The photos come of pretty well, compared to the high end flagships, it could have done with a better camera.
The UI is as always smooth and sharp with animations you'd love to see.
I suggest the fingerprint scanner icon could be used as an animation LED for notifications as it doesn't have one.

Apoorv Agarwal,A mediocre successor to OnePlus 6,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.
All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that.

Let's talk about the pros first:
Clean UI and blazing speed:
Speed and clean UI is the best in class when comes to OnePlus devices, one of the best UI I have used till now. Performance is only next to iPhone xs max and mate 20 pro, however these devices are much costlier than 6t
Display:
It's fricking good , one of the best full HD display in this range
In display finger print scanner:
Guys, this is so so good, it's very fast, not lagging as mentioned in other reviews
Battery:
Again a department where OnePlus 6t takes a big leap. I have been using poco F1 with 4000 mih battery, but 6t with 3700 mih lasts longer than poco F1.
Camera:
Camera is better than poco F1, however the night mode of 6t cannot be compared with pixel 3( you can take a shot in pitch dark), this is where OnePlus has to improve if it wants to become real flagship rather than being `flagship killer`. However I am happy with camera performance considering the price point.
Cons:
None - it would be unfair to mention anything in cons as I don't find any.

Rohan Shah,Great phone with few nuances,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"I ordered OnePlus 6T on the day of launch. Amazon delivered in a day. Wonderful, as usual.
The phone is blazing fast and it's positives are well documented across review websites and blogs. I am covering just my 1 day of initial experience with the phone.
UNBOXING - The package has a phone, charger, a 3.5 mm jack to Type C converter, a silicon case. The phone has a screen protector already fixed hence doesn't need another.
Type C converter is very useful for those using wired earphones. I use OneMore triple driver and this converter is handy.
BUILT - I have upgraded from Oneplus 3. There was nothing wrong with my previous phone just that couldn't resist upgrading. My OP3 feels slightly sleeker than this one. I must say I like the metal back of OP3 as compared to this. The rest of it is pretty good.
SCREEN - OP6T is clearly well ahead on this count. The resolution is better and so is the color quality. The difference can clearly be felt on pictures.
DATA Transfer - there is an OP switch app on playstore. Use that and it works like a charm. 36GB moved in 37 minutes with zero loss. Contacts, SMS, logs, media, apps, accounts, etc. For other phones upgrades too there are apps available.
NO 3.5 mm jack - I am a fan of my wired ear phones (I invested in OneMore triple driver which cost 9k) Convertor is a useful tool but the main issue is you can either charge the phone or use the earphones but not both at the same time.
No NOTIFICATION LED - I miss the fact that I could just glance from far to my phone and know that it needs to be seen. Here I have to lift and open it.
IN SCREEN FINGERPRINT - Saves some screen estate for sure and makes the screen feel larger. However it's not as fast and efficient as the hardware finger print. Also, hardware finger print works the moment u place the finger on it even when phone is asleep. Here u move the phone, it activates the screen and then u finger scan. Small advise - activate 'double tap to wake' and 'face unlock' and 'ok Google' so that u have multiple options to unlock the phone.
All in all, I still find the phone well worth to posses specially for the camera. I am a happy user.; I ordered OnePlus 6T on the day of launch. Amazon delivered in a day.

Sandeep Mehra,Excellent Phone (Pros and Cons in the review),4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Waited long for this phone to get launched and it was worth it. I am not a phone connoisseur but can say it's crazy fast,l. Faster than my every old phone. It's third day I have been using it and I have a few pros and cons to share so far,
Pros,
- Super fast. You click and it happens before you wink. You can feel Snapdragon 845.
- Immersive screen. It's crazy 6.41"" AMOLED edge to edge display with beautiful colors.
- Nightscape feature is really great. I have added a couple of images taken in night at a local fair for reference.
- Battery is great.
- Side slider button for turning the phone on ring, vibration and silent mode is so cool.
- Updates for next 2 years assured.
- The new Oxygen OS is excellent and flawless.
Cons,
- No 3.5 mm jack. They removed it to make room for on-screen FP sensor. An on screen sensor itself looks as a downgrade as it is not as efficient as regular sensor. OnePlus basically removed a thing we liked and replaced it with the thing we don't like.
- Dash charger is too big. It's so wide that it sometimes covers the switch next to the socket which makes it difficult to turn charging on.
- Face recognition doesn't work in complete dark and on-screen fingerprint sensor also struggles to identify your fingerprints in dark.
- If in dark you don't want to disturb someone else with light, you shouldn't use fingerprint sensor as it illuminates the screen at sensor area to be able to recognize your finger.
Verdict: It's an excellent phone Despite of few cons I give it full marks. It's a good buy.

FaizA,Not so Good Not so bad,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Hello Guys,
I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.
1- battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.
2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.
3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.
4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed in 20k phone easily.
5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.
Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and
2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.
If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.

OS is light and packs everything I ever needed, screen is gorgeous, the feel is premium , camera is top notch.
There is no notification LED , which I thought was a short coming but I soon realized it is a rather distracting feature, with my old phone, Everytime I saw the light, I'd jump at the opportunity to see what's up , with the 6T I don't have to unlock the phone every 30 secs, which some how improves my productivity keeps me focused on the thing I'm doing.
Oh and the charging is freaking aaaammmaaazing.
This is my review.

Dash charge, charges very fast keeping the battery long enough for 8-9 hours for heavy users.

Only downside is from software side, oxygen os is very fluid and smooth, 1)android pie has its issues, adaptive brightness automatically shift itself to lowest light every time screen goes off. So need update on that side.

The phone take time to get used to, especially with the cover. the cover is thick enough to take away the sexy glass black look. But without the cover it is gorgeous.
Also,the fingerprint sensor is neither too accurate nor fast. coming from oneplus 3, i feel fingerprint is a downgrade. but the animation is awesome and faceunlock is amazingly fast.
Its really snappy and fast phone and 128Gigs of Memory is superb. gives phone enough space to function.
The Nightscape is fantabulous. so precise and works so awesomely even in quite dark pictures. really worth it
The headphone jack removal is not a big thing for me, but it migut be for some who dont want to switch to usb type c headphones. but yes tbh, type c is the future and we gonna get used to it sooner or later.
overall loved it and its quite classy in hand. the promotions and discount were great. go for it.; I would say things which is not so known fron lal the reviews and videos.

SRI DURGA,The Beast In Your Hand,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Yes, i bought it. It is an upgrade from 3T to 6T and I do have Onplus 6 also. Compared these two and matched exactly the same for their attributes on the paper and their usage. What really feels good is the new tear drop or water drop notched display. I really like the way they placed it.
Coming to Pros:
1. It would be a massive upgrade if you're using 4gb ram or lower previously.
2. Screen To Body ratio
3. Processing speed of the CPU and GPU
4. Tall looking screen than the wide screen.
5. Finger print scanner under the screen is real quick. Ofcourse I would testing more on this and give some feedback OnePlus team.
6. Face Unlock is much quicker than the Finger print scanner
Cons:
One thing I really felt low was Sound Enhancement is not getting enabled when connected through bluetooth.
NightScape mode is not upto the mark.

 Pros:
-Great performance.
-Top notch display.
-Fingerprint reader is actually pretty fast if
you set it up properly
-Awesome battery life, I get around 10
hours screen on time and you can get a
day's charge in 30 mins of charging.
-Oxygen os is the best software experience
you can get on an Android phone hands down, and the navigation gestures are fluid and fun to use.
-Cameras are just amazing , you can't tell any difference when you compare it with the pics taken in a pixel or a Samsung Galaxy. And it's it wayyy better than iphone cameras c:
You can shoot videos upto 4k 60fps and it is very smooth and sharp.
Front facing camera works well too ( get Google cam Port for the best portrait selfies, you're welcome)
-Build quality is very good, best looking and feeling Android phone under 40k.
Cons:
- No headphone jack. RIP jack.
but as long as you get the usb c bullets, you won't miss it at all, and you don't have to worry about using ur earphones while charging because you will hardly spend time charging this phone. Charge it when you wake up and get ready for the day and have a cup of coffee and it will be charged
-No wireless charging, but hey dash charge ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-No major upgrades from the OnePlus 6, if you own a OP6, don't get this phone. Wait for a 7 or 7t

Amaze_cust,Awesome phone!! Worth the wait,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"This is my first one plus phone so I m might not know the plight of earlier users but for me the phone scores highly on all aspects.
1. Fingerprint sensor: it takes some initial attempts to train the model. You'll feel that recognition is slow at first but once trained it works like butter.
2. Camera: superb features added. Everything looks life like with the dual aperture camera. Front camera is extremely good too. Overall one of the best cameras in the industry.
3. Battery: I charged it once on arrival and haven't recharged it in the past 2 days. In any case, powerbanks have become the norm.
4. The speed: Android pi combined with an amazing processor. Watching a movie while tracking your food order has never been easier!
5. Launch offers: so I guess the phone is worth 28-30k. That's why there have been so many launch offers. Wait for some time and then buy this beast.
Some cons:
1. It is a bit heavy.

primeuser,Comparisons with oneplus 6,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Great phone, nice features set just as one plus 6.
But having used oneplus 6 for a couple of months before buying this I would say that after a few days of using this the novelty has worn off, meaning that the basic difference between two phones which is of finger scanner is not a big deal after a few days into usage.
Other than that the phone is rock solid,, better battery, don't miss the headphone jack, notch is smaller phone more heftier (good).

Sharath,Fast and Smooth. The BEASTüòà,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Amazon Delivery is excellent as always. Got it delivered within a day, that too, to my native city(Non Metro, not Bangalore).
Coming to phone itself, had ordered Mirror Black 8/128 GB variant.
Pros:
1. Excellent build quality
2. Great fluid smooth Oxygen OS
3. Display is gorgeous. Feels bit longer and tad narrower than OnePlus 6's screen. (Tech spec also says so.)
4. Felt sound quality over earphones (JBL E1+) is great... Compared to my previous OnePlus2. Felt comparatively better than OnePlus6. Though I don't have any test result to show, I just heard sound effects of same song on both OnePlus6 and 6T, Base and clarity of music on OnePlus 6T just felt refined if not same.
5. Camera. Just awesome. Nightscape is good in low light. Very snappy camera. They r soft features which r coming to OnePlus 6 anyway.
6. In Display fingerprint, well it's a good tech. Works well most of the time,even though not as fast as physical sensor. Did a false unlock with non registered finger when I was testing üòä. It happened just once. Bleeds bright light from the sensor area while unlocking,(well that's how it's technology work)which might be annoying during night with sleepy eyesüòê. Face unlock works like a charm.Its even faster than Screen Unlock. Only downside is Face unlock is image based.hence require sufficient light on face to recognize you. Also, you need to turn on screen to unlock, unlike IR based sensor in iPhone X or Huawei Mate 20.
7. PUBG game looks gorgeous with HDR and Ultra frame rate settings. No lag or stuttering whatsoever. Game runs fast n smooth with great graphics.
Cons: (not many)
1. In display fingerprint sensor even though worlds fastest among In Display sensors in terms of unlocking speed, need more polishing. Not as fast as physical. But u will not know much difference if u r coming from OnePlus2. Unlocking bleeds bright light on sensor area might be annoying at night.
2. No Headphone jack might be deal breaker for some. But they give type c to 3.5mm adapter in box. So shud not be as much as deal breaker. Pre-Order will fetch u a type c headphones for free.

Joysurya Gupta,Oxygen OS is love,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Including the discount I got OP6t at 34.5k. I have been using this phone heavily for 3days now. Worth mentioning the Oxygen OS is one of the best in market and has the capability to challenge the IOS. Its a bliss to play games in OP 6t. Camera is good and specially the nightscape mode.
Charging is very fast with the dash charger. Fingerprint and face unlock is swift. This is a kind of phone you can easily recommend to someone.
But they could have easily added the headphone jack.

 You've probably watched various reviews on YouTube so I'll cut to the chase.
If you want a very fast and smooth OS experience, no lag, timely software updates along with the premium feel, just go for it.
Fingerprint Scanner : Sometimes it's crazy fast, sometimes it takes time, you get used to it. After using indisplay fingerprint scanner, you'll forget about rear mounted ones.
Notch : This looks extremely good compared to oneplus 6
Camera : Both Cameras nowhere close to my S9+. But easily beats a number of other smartphones.
Storage : you get around 115gb free
Ram: 6gb is more than enough. 4000 inr for extra 2gb is not worth it.
Face Unlock : Probably The Fastest Out There.
Gaming : Games load faster than ever.A lot Faster Than S9+
Display : Display is crisp and clear with FHD+ resolution. But since i have been using S9+ also so i can clearly see difference between QHD and FHD display. Brightness is less compared to S9+. HDR 4K videos are supported in 6T
Charging : 1 hour 15 minutes for full charge ( Can Vary Depending On How and When You Plug In)
OS : Android 9 With November Security Patch
Speakers : Same As 5T,6. Nothing New Here
Audio Jack : Gone. Using Dongle Is Not Everyone's Cup Of Tea. But Those Prebooked Will Get Type C Earphones. So no worries here.
Heavier Than 5T,6 due to increased battery size.
Hope you find this useful for your purchase

Aman,Switching over from Apple!,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"Switching over from my Iphone 8 to Oneplus 6t.
1 - Speed
Yes, Oneplus claims the truth that you're going to ""Unlock Speed"" with this one. The face unlock and brand new in display fingerprint in this phone is insanely fast.
2- Hardware
The built quality of the phone gives you a very premium feel, glass back , amazing curved design, oled screen and teardrop notch can give a bummer to any other premium smartphone in the market.
3- Processor
Damn, I love this one, Snapdragon 845 and 8GB of RAM makes it one of the fastest phones in the world right now, get ready for an amazing never lagging gaming experience and user interface.
4- Software
Andriod 9, Pie and Oxygen OS makes the interface of the phone look beautiful, and it looks beautiful to me as I've been using apple for past two years with same interface. Gestures, customizations and various other oxygen os features give you a very good in-phone experience.
5- Camera
Amazing for low light photography, I haven't test the camera much, would edit my review after testing it for sometime.
CONS
1- It would be great if Oneplus launches phones with IP water resistant certificate and Wireless Charging from next time.
2- Include the Type C bullet earphones inside the box itself.

I was looking for a camera, storage and battery upgrade so 6t checks all the boxes. I miss the headphone jack as it's an inconvenience to carry that usb dongle everywhere. It comes installed with android pie and man it's buttery smooth. Thanks to oneplus community, software and user experience is something which oneplus takes very seriously. In screen Fingerprint sensor is pretty good but not quite as fast as the physical sensor. However the difference is minor. Camera is same as oneplus 6 with some software improvements. Bigger battery makes a difference and I am getting 7 hours of SOT. A screen protector is pre-applied on the phone and comes with a silicone case in the box. Although it does the job but I would recommend to get a sturdy bumper case. No need to apply any tempered glass on the screen.
Hate the fact oneplus keep on increasing the prices for every new model and I fear it might reach that flagship price 40k+ very soon.

shourya,Features no one would tell you,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Switched from one plus x(A medium size phone) to one plus 6t.
Overall in my family there is a lot of varieties of phones such as Iphone 7 plus,Redmi note 5 pro, Samsung Galaxy s8.
But before this I was using one plus x because of of it's compact size and still some respectable speed.
If you comapare op 6t with a mid range device you would find out some really good differences.
Here are some of my extra features that nobody gonna tell you.
* Gaming mode- I loved it.
*It's UI is super fast you can't see any lag there
*Gesture mode is nice.
* Switching of apps is very fast and quick
* Nightscape mode is somewhat good rather than normal shot
* There is studio lighting in front camera while doing the flash on which gives you a warmer photo.
*Battery is larger than the op6 and full charging(10-100%) takes around 55 minutes.
* I have played 12 full games of pubg and still battery was 17%

If you are planning nto buy a phone that can live in the market for 2.5-3 years and you need a flagship ..this is the phone.

Tanmay,The greatest phone!,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"It is the greatest phone ever! Good hardware combined with excellent software.
6T ticks all the boxes of the modern day flagships, plus it has in-display fingerprint which is surprisingly fast and more convenient than the one mounted on the back.
It has improved battery backup, large storage options at relatively same price, excellent memory management and the best UI you will find on a phone.
The Oxygen OS gives you the latest offerings from Android and is very responsive and very pleasing just to look at!üòç It gives you a lot of customisation options to make your phone feel more personal.
The only small setback is an average camera. But don't worry, it's pretty good and can do a great job capturing images and won't disappoint you.
This is the best buy for 30-40k budget segment and you won't regret buying it.
I am very happy with this phone.üòç

Talking about the phone, been using it from past 3days now, here are some key points :
*Not a single lag till now-superfast interface
*Clear and nice photos -esp. Night mode works better
*Large display with a small notch, trust me once you have it you won't get annoyed, don't listen to negative reviews
*Cool gestures
*Gaming experience
*No heating problems, whatsoever
*Dash charging- battery performance is also good!
And what not, in short, I would say whatever the company is advertising it's true in reality.
It's my first Oneplus phone and I'm loving it !

sunithbabu,Review OnePlus 6T,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....
I don't know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.
Read till the last for my last suggestion
1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I'm sure this is the best Offer one can get and I'm sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.
2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.
3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.
4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool
5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months
6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.
7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage
8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area
9) The charging rate is good, I'm sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage
10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I've used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don't like this.
11) I've used the phone with google maps ""ON"" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.
12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That's up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.
13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I'm not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...
14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here
15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...
I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.
As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage condition
Trust Me friends, don't waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera; First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast !

Pinak Dusane,Elegance at its best,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"There have been lots of talks about this phone and it has been really interesting. I come from Apple ecosystem and I am not a big fan of Android but I gotta say the OnePlus 6T didn't let me down a bit. Especially because of the OxygenOS. It's magical. Here are some reviews about the features.
The fingerprint sensor: okay so this gotta come first right? Personally I was not so sure about this feature. I mean it looked cool and all but I was confused whether it'll be worth or not and believe me it is. It's hardly a few milliseconds slower than the traditional scanner and to be honest that doesn't matter at all. It's way much more convenient than a rear fingerprint scanner. It's quick and it looks really good. I've tried it many times and it has only failed to register my finger once when I had some oil on it. Otherwise it's always perfect.
Display: the display is vivid and beautiful. Nothing much to say but the notch is really nice.
Camera: the cameras are great. I had expected an upgrade in this department but they still take some great photos. I have added one here for sample. It's just beautiful.
Battery: oh I love the battery backup. It's amazing. It easily lasts for a day and half. And dash charge is magical. The phone is charged before you even know it.
Hardware and software: the hardware is so premium. This is what differentiates this phone and the cheap stupid Pocophone. This looks and feels so premium. There is a very underrated feature about this phone actually. OnePlus had said that they have improved the antenna of this phone and it really works great. I mean places where other people are not able to load Instagram on the same network, I can easily play PUBG at full hd graphics without lag and also watch YouTube videos in 1080p. This is maybe the most important feature of this phone. And talking about gaming this phone runs games smoothly as expected and there are never any lags anywhere in any app. Coming to the software OxygenOS is great. I daresay it's better than stock Android too. It has so many little things in it. It's all these little things that make it so interesting and user friendly. I am literally in love with it.
Lastly the headphone jack. Yeah it's not there and I am not a huge fan of that but it's really not as big of a deal as people are making it sound. They are just ranting about it like crybabies. Get over it. It's not there but it doesn't suck that much. You just don't get to listen to music while you're charging if you still use the wired headphones and this phone charges real quick. So although it's a downside it's not really a big deal. I mean I am not gonna hate a phone just because it doesn't have a headphone jack. I wish the dumb MI fans will understand it someday too.

It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all.
They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone.; The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad.

Raghuram Madireddy,Speed that you need... Simply Awesome..... Most Powerful Phone in Smartphone Industry..!!!!!!!!!!!,4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"The OnePlus 6T is a truly great phone no matter what the price, but at half the cost of an iPhone XS with a cutting-edge in display fingerprint sensor this is the bargain buy of the year. Everybody is complaing about in-display fingerprint scanner is slow but trust me its very very very fast, phone gets unlocked as soon as your finger touches the screen and more accurate than other phones, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesn‚Äôt have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just 37K. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom is simply amazing, coming to camera the new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good Portrait mode works as advertised, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good and when you use the fingerprint sensor the night mode for the display is disabled temporarily and then fades back in once you‚Äôve unlocked the phone. The phone comes with a screen protector already on it. the single bottom-firing speaker is loud and has a relatively large amount of bass for the phone, but is easily blocked while playing a game. OnePlus‚Äôs alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and is still brilliant. OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. That‚Äôs changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing what‚Äôs possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and it‚Äôs a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive. there‚Äôs no wireless charging, it doesn‚Äôt have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.
Pros:- Good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5, great software, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, affordable price relative to premium phones, last but not least Blazing fast software
Cons:- No notification light, glass back but no wireless charging, no expandable storage.
Overall phone is excellent and it really delivers it's tagline Never Settle.

The screen is awesome and the notch is not that bad. The phone feels fast and responsive and oxygen os is pretty good in my opinion. The camera is decent although I would have loved a different secondary lens like a wide angle one. Battery lasts me a full day easily and still has 30% charge remaining by the end. There are a few minor compromises but they dont matter to me personally so I have nothing to complain but i'll still list them out. They say its water resistant but it has no IP certification so I don't know exactly how water resistant it is. No headphone jack but I already used bluetooth headphones even when my phone had a headphone jack so not missing it at all. No wireless charging but I dont use that either so doesn't matter to me. Lastly to me the phone is a looker, I love its looks and seamless design.

Sunil N.,One Plus 6T,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,Really like the product. There are very minute changes between the 6 and 6T. If you have the 6 then this product isn't a big upgrade however if you are planning to buy this phone as an upgrade from say the 5 then yes it surely is a steal deal. The in screen finger sensor is rather slow but the face unlock compensates this. I personally use only Bluetooth but users may find the headphone jack not being there as an inconvenience. The connector that's been provided works wonders and if you look at it in a better way Bluetooth headphones have now become cheaper in today's world. Over all I would say 4.5 as the inscreen sensor is a little slow but I'm sure they would work on this feature soon.; Really like the product. There are very minute changes between the 6 and 6T.

Abhishek Chakravorty,NEVER SETTLE? NOT THIS TIME. [MOST DETAILED REVIEW],4 November 2018,Size: 6+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-
This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.
CONS (Ranked) -
1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.
2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.
3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.
4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.
5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.
P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.
PROS (Ranked) -
1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.
2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.
3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.
4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.
5. Great screen.
6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.
7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.
P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..
All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.

This time, it's all about a new InScreen fingerprint sensor and a smaller notch
Cons:
1. Inscreen Fingerprint is Slow.
2. Low light Photography not much improved
Prons:
1. 3700mAh battery Supporting fast charging.
2. Screen Size increased by 23% against the predecessor with a smaller notch
3. SUPERFAST FACEUNLOCK which will beat Inscreen fingerprint in unlocking the phone.
4. Amazing Built & the device is pretty sleek and is really very fast.
5. The camera is excellent.
6. Excellent Ram Management.
6. No Heating Problem while playing heavy graphics GAMES
Overall Rating: 8.5/10 (Rating Deducted due to slow InScreenFingerprint)

Mohammad Naumaan K,Don't think again... Go for it,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Mirror Black,Verified Purchase,"Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.
Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).
Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.
Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.
I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.
Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone.; Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade.

Surya Kiran,Value for money. Hardware and Software are top notch.,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.
Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.
I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.

Bhaskar G,High performance and super fast !!!,4 November 2018,Size: 8+128 GB,Colour: Midnight Black,Verified Purchase,"First time experience with One plus device and I'm happy with the purchase. Fast processing speed, face recognition technology is super quick, on-display finger print scanner is quite fun to use, amazing camera quality (though picture quality in nightscape mode is prone to blurry images if the subject is moving, probably need to test this feature with a tripod for better results).
Overall the look and feel of this phone is amazing. Just hold this beauty in your hand and you'll love it.
